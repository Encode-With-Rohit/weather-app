**This is basic weather application built over python using flask.**

With the help of openweathermap's API we can fetch the weather conditions across the world. 
If a user wants to check the weather condition of any region, the app will provide enough historic weather stats.

- API deployment is being done by using www.render.com 

- Production URL : https://weatherapp-qele.onrender.com/
